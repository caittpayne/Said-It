## Motivation <a id="motivation"></a>

Said-It was my first project using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Jasmine. My goal for the project was to gain a better understanding of Node.js and using JS for backend development.

At first, this project was very challenging, as I didn't have experience working on the backend of applications. However, after diving into the material I found I really loved working with Node.js. I love working with databases, so building an application where I had control over CRUD operations on the data was exciting to me.

Another motivation for this project was to learn the principles of Test Driven Development and implement Unit Tests throughout building the application. After the initial learning curve, I found writing these tests saved a lot of work later in the project when implementing new features. I see how creating these tests ensures that changes made in the future do not affect the current code base.
